He is currently under the responsiblity of Luci, the newest member of the Guardian Angel Bureau.</p><p>The goal of the game is to lead Dave into the exit. Dave has certain rules for a path that you can predict. You control Luci and are able to change this path by moving around boxes around the level. Though if you aren't careful, Dave might fall into a pitfall or a cliff and you will fail the level. The game contains multiple areas that you unlock over time, each area introduces a new game mechanic. There are more than 30 levels that you can play with.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment"><div class="title-segment">The Project</div><p>The game was developed in around 2 months within a team of 5 and Agile was used for this project. The Unity game engine was used. Most of the assets and sounds were improted externally from the asset store, though some models were made ourselves. The game was developed indside my univeristy subject <i>Game Design Studio 1</i>.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment"><div class="title-segment">Game Design</div><p>The team actively collaborated on the game design. We decided upon a feel that has planning and execution at the same time whereby players must prepare and plan out on the main puzzle but then have this moment where they have to rush to place boxes and keep Dave alive. We also vision players to have a laugh when forgot something or needed to be quicker, restart and make another quick attempt to beat the level.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment"><div class="title-segment">Grid System</div><img src="assets/ProjectAngel-grid.png"/><p>Since the game occured on a grid, I built a grid system that forms the foundations of the game mechanic. The grid system allows coordinates of objects to be located efficiently. Tiles in the grid can be occupied by multiple objects (though in most cases there is only one object) and we can use this to look up occupancy of a tile and determine if a box can be placed or what Dave should do.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment"><div class="title-segment">Game Mechanics</div><img src="assets/ProjectAngel-Dave.gif"/><p>I was responsible for making the logic for how Dave moves about the level. I think I took most of my time determining the rules for Dave. When Dave hits a wall, he will turn left or right depending on which direction is closer in distance to the exit. He will also turn-around if we can't turn left or right. Without compromising design, the rules is kept simple an thus the implementation became straightforward. I think that when developing more issues arise from the early grid system.</p><p>Though one of the challenging implementations was the line prediction. I took a similar approach to an earlier project,&nbsp; <a href="./the-expanse">The Expanse</a>. A simulation of Dave's movement was performed several steps into the future. This allowed accurate information about where Dave will go. The code was organised such that a moving Dave only means moving one step in the simulation but with real effects.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment"><div class="title-segment">Level Design</div><p>Everyone in the team has contributed with level design, hence a lot of level ideas can be generated. As we proceed with development, we needed to make a level design philosophy that is consistent and everyone can agree on. The challenge of a level can be categorised into three categories. A planning challenge where players need to find the right solution to the puzzle, an execution challenge where the players have to act fast enough or they could be both a planning and execution challenge.</p><p>The general level design process starts with the idea. This can be anything from a certain puzzle, an aesthetic or just something fun. Then we would review the levels and pick out the ones that stand out. This level is then given to playtesters. Once the level is ready and finalised, decorations can be put into the level in terms of props.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment"><div class="title-segment">Editor Tools</div><p>During the project, I developed editor tools that lets us create levels much more quickly as well as make quick edits much easier to the point that coming up with an idea for a level is easier to do in the editor than drawn on paper.</p><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><video height="500" preload autoplay muted style="pointer-events: none;" disablepictureinpicture loop><source src="assets/ProjectAngel-Editor.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div><p>The first tool I made was a essentially a paint brush which is made significantly easier by the grid-like levels and the grid system. The designer is able to quickly switch between the different tiles and rapidly adjust the level layout. Tiles can also be rotated so that tiles like roads can be made much easily. Usually the layout is played with a few times before being finalised and decorated.</p><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><video height="500" preload autoplay muted style="pointer-events: none;" disablepictureinpicture loop><source src="assets/ProjectAngel-Fence.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div><p>The second tool I made was an automatic fence decorator. Decorating levels can take some time and by being able to generate a fence around the level, it saves half the effort for decorating. Different areas have different fence styles.</p></div></div></div><div class="row segment-footer justify-content-center"><div class="col-3"><p class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center m-3"><b>Contact</b> razinagida@gmail.com</p></div></div></div></body></html>
