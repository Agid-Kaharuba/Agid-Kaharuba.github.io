Players get to play as one of the children of the recently deceased Pharaoh, gifted with the power of the gods. They must enter a deadly battle against their siblings in order to claim the empty throne for themselves.</p><p>This is a first-person shooter, where players will have to shoot their opponent to gain kills and win. Players have to choose between characters, each one having a unique abilities and playstyle. Matches are quick usually around 5 mintues and are played between 2-6 players (though it's best with 3-6 players). The game has multiple game modes such getting the most amount of kills, control points, first to a number kills and lives, all of which are configurable. The game has 3 maps that players are able to choose from.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">The Project</div><p>This project was developed by a team of 5 core members consisting of game designers, game programmers and 3D artists. Other members include 3 music and sound specialists. We utilised Agile methodlogies for this project under the timescale of 4 months. The game is built using the Unity Engine. This was univeristy subject called <i>Game Design Studio 2</i>.</p><p>I was mainly responsible for handling the multiplayer networking and programming game mechanics. I also designed the architecture for the codebase, created editor tools and worked a little on devOps. Though the team is purposfuly flexible, which means that I got to cover a bunch of general programming.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">Characters and Abilities</div><div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center"><img width="420" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTE4NzIyMC83NTU0MjEzLnBuZw==/original/bACttB.png"><div class="d-flex"><img width="420" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTE4NzIyMC83NTU0MjAxLnBuZw==/original/PS%2Fg3Q.png"> <img width="420" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTE4NzIyMC83NTU0MTg2LnBuZw==/original/xOhaEk.png"></div><div class="d-flex"><img width="420" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTE4NzIyMC83NTU0MjI0LnBuZw==/original/uBNaO%2B.png"> <img width="420" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTE4NzIyMC83NTU0MjMxLnBuZw==/original/Snpd86.png"></div></div><p>A lot of time and focus was spent character abilities as it is the fun part of the game and a major component. Along with maps, it gives variety and replayability. Our intention was to make each character feel unique. Though by keeping the same shooting mechanic and constraining ourselves to only one active ability (abilities that can be activated) and one passive ability (abilities that passively affect the character), I think we picked a nice middle ground between keeping each character unique and having design constraints to both keep the idea viable as well as giving the right amount of uniqeness to each character.</p><p>Getting the right ability for each character can be quite challenging and time-consuming. Having an ability that is underpowered (relatively weak) means that players would have a bad experience playing that character. In the worst case, it would discourage players from playing that character and impact the game replayability by having less variety. Each character should also have something interesting about them that makes them worth playing.</p><p></p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">Multiplayer Networking</div><p>Developing a multiplayer game is a big challenge that the entire team must endure. Seemingly simple features take much more effort to implement to keep up with multiplayer. But the payoff is an experience that is unrivaled, playing with people offer an abundance in game content, and playing with friends is a lot more fun than playing alone. This was the first time that I got involved into a multiplayer project.</p><p>In the early phases of the project, I started exploring and investigating multiplayer frameworks that would be a good fit for the team. I settled on using the Mirror framework with Epic Online Services for the transport. Using this combination allowed us to provide a zero-cost multiplayer service which is perfect for our scope. This is because the framework operate on a server-client model whereby a player is assigned as a host. While this has the major drawback of being prone to cheating from the host player, it was out of scope for the project since most of our players will be playing with their friends. Additionally, the framework also allowed extendability in the future when needed.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">Matchmaking</div><p>One of the hardest and most complex things I worked on is the matchmaking system. The system had to be entirely designed and built from scratch. I was elaborate when building this system with stability as a focus since networking can arise a whole bunch of issues most of which can be significantly difficult to detect. Having a multiplayer game with inconsistent networking can be greatly offputing for players. As such many different potential errors and possible scenarios need to be considered.</p><p>The matchmaking lets players join lobbies. Players can be in a bunch of different states. They could be inside a lobby, is ready, is waiting for the server to be ready, connecting to the server, inside a game and not inside a lobby. Each of these states must be recoverable in the event that a networking issues arise.</p><p>I think that the matchmaking system is not perfect. It has multiple instances where problems caused some issues, I think that more work on it may improve its maturity and reliability. However, I think it has been quite practical such that it works 85% of the time. This is deemed acceptable considering the development time constaint.</p></div></div></div><div class="row segment-footer justify-content-center"><div class="col-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row align-items-center m-2"><p><b>Contact</b></p><p></p><p>razinagida@gmail.com</p><p></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
