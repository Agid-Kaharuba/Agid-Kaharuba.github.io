Players must navigate their spacecraft across the trechorous void of space. Space travel is much different than other modes of transport, they must rely on orbital mechanics to get there. They can manipulate this by having the power to control the strength of gravity, allowing them to boost the momentum of the spacecraft by preforing gravity slingshots (commonly known as gravity assists). However, going through space without spectacularly crashing the spacecraft may be difficult.</p><p>This is one of the first few games that I have created. The game was made by a team 3 and took about a month to develop. It developed under Introduction to Game Design subject at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">Orbital Mechanics</div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><video height="500" preload autoplay muted style="pointer-events: none;" disablepictureinpicture loop><source src="assets/TheExpanse-longOrbit.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div><p>The game is based on newtonian physics which is efficient and accurate enough for this case. Since newtonian physics tend to be less accurate with extremely high and low sources of gravity, we need a couple of tweaks that prevent biazarre behaviour in those circumstances.</p><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><video height="500" preload autoplay muted style="pointer-events: none;" disablepictureinpicture loop><source src="assets/TheExpanse-shortOrbit.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div><p>I also worked a lot on the orbital line prediction which took a good chunk amount of time to implement. In essence, the game has to run multiple steps of the simulation into the future to be able to predict an accurate trajectory for the spacecraft. Since players are able to alter the the trajectory by manipulating gravity, the entire prediction has to be done in regular intervals.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">Game Mechanics</div><p>I think one of the most interesting thing that makes this game unique are the game mechanics. One of the greatest challenges that we have is by delving into innovation, it created a risk such that a larger amount of time is required to get it right. There are very minimal reference points and hence we had to slowly find the right feel for the mechanic.</p><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><video height="500" preload autoplay muted style="pointer-events: none;" disablepictureinpicture loop><source src="assets/TheExpanse-manipulate.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div><p>I spent a lot of time perfecting the main game mechanic of controling gravity and orbitals. These need to support the core idea of players doing gravitational slingshots to maneuver. Most importantly, the mechanic had to be easy and intuitive for players. It was discovered early in the project that the mechanic was too difficut and needed more tweaking but when done just right, mastery can be both fun and challenging. Despite me spending the majority of the project on this, I think it is still far from perfect.</p><p>One notion to understand as a game designer is that it has to feel right for the players, which doesn't necessarily mean that is has to be accurate or realistic. Making a platformer controls feel nice means accommodating to the fact that our human perceptions are flawed. At one point, I realised that it isn't much fun to be stuck in space because you have very low momentum. To combat this, I made gravity controls stronger for low gravity situations which made the whole control scheme feel much more intuitive. This is a quirk that players will not usually notice akin to coyote time in platformers. Conversely I made the gravity controls weaker in high gravity (close to a body) to prevent sudden and uncontrollable acceleration.</p></div></div></div><div class="row segment-footer justify-content-center"><div class="col-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row align-items-center m-2"><p><b>Contact</b></p><p></p><p>razinagida@gmail.com</p><p></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
