Within the first 8 hours of the jam, I managed to get a working prototype for this rope-like mechanic. However, it was far from what we wanted. The rope still needed to collide with the obstacles and break when there is too much force. In comparision, getting there was much harder.</p><p>I had to try multiple different implementations within the constraints of the Unity engine. I was actually becoming desperate towards the middle of the jam since then implementations always had a chance to produce a physics breaking result. However with meticilously adding tweaks and some assistance from my teammates we finally got it working.</p></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="content-segment" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="title-segment">Rope Physics</div><p>To get the basics working, I imagined the concept of pendulums and weight in physics. There is a pivot at the character at which the hypothetical pendulum can swing. Then the weight needs to also be heavy enough to cause a drag and hence when the player moves the attached weight can produce a swinging motion. Though one difference to a normal pendulum is that the rope is able to bend to some extent. To achieve this, the rope can be divided enough times such that there pivots with a small mass that is able to swing as well. A line renderer from Unity can be then used to render the rope across the pivots.</p><p>Next, the obstacles need to interact with the rope. To build upon the previous step, the pivots in the rope need to be seperated with box colliders. Since we want the rope to only break after a certain amount of force (allowing players to recover and creating a fun moment), these colliders are allowed to collide with the obstacles. Only when the colliders are seperated large enough by the obstacle that the rope will break due to how the physics interaction allows the box colliders to seperate in the pivots.</p></div></div></div><div class="row segment-footer justify-content-center"><div class="col-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row align-items-center m-2"><p><b>Contact</b></p><p></p><p>razinagida@gmail.com</p><p></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
